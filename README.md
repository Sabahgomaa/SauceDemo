# Sacedemo.com Java/Selenium Automation Tests
 The **Sacedemo.com Java/Selenium Automation Tests** project contains automated GUI tests to ensure the application’s quality and reliability. It includes tests for login (successful and failed), adding items to the cart (specific, random, or most expensive), checking total price, and logout. Common setup is handled in BaseTest and BaseTestWithLogin. The suite focuses on verifying the user interface’s functionality, responsiveness, and consistency using **Java, Selenium WebDriver**, and TestNG with the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.
